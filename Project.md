## Next.js

**Question:** Can you describe a specific project where you utilized Next.js, the challenges you faced, and how you overcame them?

**Answer:**

In a recent project, I developed a dynamic e-commerce platform using Next.js. The goal was to create a site that was SEO-friendly, fast, and capable of handling both static and dynamic content effectively.

One of the primary challenges was ensuring the site was `SEO-optimized`, as this was crucial for attracting organic traffic. I utilized Next.js’s `server-side rendering` (SSR) and `static site generation` (SSG) features to create pages that search engines could easily index. This approach improved our search visibility and user acquisition.

Performance was another critical factor. I optimized images using `Next.js’s built-in image optimization` capabilities and implemented code splitting and lazy loading to enhance page load times. This significantly improved the user experience, especially for `mobile users`.

`Dynamic routing` was essential for handling product pages, which had to be generated based on product IDs. Next.js’s `file-based routing` made this straightforward, and I used dynamic paths to generate the necessary pages efficiently.

`Managing state` across the application, such as the `shopping cart and user authentication`, was another challenge. I addressed this by implementing a global state management solution using `React Context and the useReducer hook`, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

Overall, Next.js provided robust solutions to these challenges, resulting in a fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly e-commerce platform. This experience solidified my hands-on expertise with Next.js and its powerful features for modern web development.
