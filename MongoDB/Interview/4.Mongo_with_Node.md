### Benefits of Repository Pattern


* **Abstraction**: It abstracts data source details, providing a consistent interface for data operations across diverse storage mechanisms.

* **Modularity**: Repositories encapsulate data logic, enabling modular and reusable code components.

* **Maintenance**: Changes to data source or structure are localised within repositories, simplifying maintenance efforts.

* **Testing**: Repositories facilitate isolated unit testing by allowing mock implementations.

* **Caching**: Data caching can be implemented within repositories for improved performance.

* **Query Logic**: Complex queries and filtering logic are centralised in repositories.

* **Database Agnosticism**: The pattern enables flexibility in switching between different data sources.

* **Security**: Repositories can enhance security through parameterised queries and validation.
