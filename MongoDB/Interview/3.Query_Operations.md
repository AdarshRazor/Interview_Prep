# MongoDB Questions (Query Operations and Projection)

## Q1. What are MongoDB query operators? Provide some examples.

MongoDB query operators are used to specify criteria in queries and to perform a variety of operations, such as comparison, logical operations, and element evaluation.

* **$eq**: Matches values that are equal to a specified value.
* **$gt**: Matches values that are greater than a specified value.
* **$lt**: Matches values that are less than a specified value.
* **$in**: Matches any of the values specified in an array.
* **$and**: Joins query clauses with a logical AND.
* **$or**: Joins query clauses with a logical OR.

## Q2. How does the $regex operator work in MongoDB? Provide an example query.

The `$regex` operator provides regular expression capabilities for pattern matching strings in queries.

```json
{ "name": { "$regex": "^A", "$options": "i" } }
```

## Q3. Explain how to use the $regex operator to find documents where the 'name' field starts with 'apple'.

```json
db.products.find({ name: /^apple/ });
```

## Q3. What is projection in MongoDB and why is it useful?

Projection in MongoDB is the process of selecting specific fields to return in query results. It is useful for:

* Reducing the amount of data transferred over the network.
* Improving query performance by retrieving only necessary data.

```json
db.collection.find({ "status": "active" }, { "name": 1, "email": 1, "_id": 0 })
```

## Q4. How do you perform a projection to exclude specific fields in MongoDB?

To exclude specific fields in a projection, set their values to 0.

```json
db.collection.find({}, { "password": 0, "creditCardNumber": 0 })
```
>This query returns all fields except password and creditCardNumber.

## Q5. What is the purpose of the $slice operator in MongoDB projection? Provide an example.

The `$slice` operator limits the number of elements in an array returned by a query.

```json
db.collection.find({}, { "comments": { "$slice": 5 } })
```

## Q6. Describe how the $elemMatch projection operator works. Provide an example.

The $elemMatch projection operator limits the contents of an array field to contain only the first element that matches the specified query condition.

```json
db.collection.find(
  { "results": { "$elemMatch": { "score": { "$gt": 80 } } } },
  { "results": { "$elemMatch": { "score": { "$gt": 80 } } } }
)
```

This query matches documents where the `results` array contains at least one element with a `score` greater than 80, and projects only that element.

## Q7. What is the purpose of the $ operator in projections, and how does it differ from its use in updates?

In projections, the `$` operator limits the output to contain only the first array element that matches the query condition. In updates, it identifies the first matching element in an array for modification.

```json
db.collection.find(
  { "results.score": { "$gt": 80 } },
  { "results.$": 1 }
)
```

This query returns documents where results.score is greater than 80, projecting only the first matching results array element.

```json
db.collection.updateOne(
  { "results.score": { "$gt": 80 } },
  { "$set": { "results.$.score": 90 } }
)
```

This query updates the `score` to 90 for the first element in the `results` array that matches the condition `score > 80`.
