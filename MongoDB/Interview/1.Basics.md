# MongoDB Questions (Basics)

## Q1. What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a `NoSQL database` that uses a document-oriented data model. It stores data in flexible, `JSON-like documents`, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.

## Q2. How does MongoDB differ from traditional relational databases?

* **Data Model**: Uses `documents and collections` instead of **tables and rows.**
* **Schema**: `Schema-less`, allowing dynamic changes to the structure of documents.
* **Scalability**: Designed for `horizontal scaling` through sharding.
* **Query Language**: Uses a `rich, JSON-based` query language.

> MongoDB is schema-less, meaning you don't need to define a rigid structure for your documents upfront. You can add or remove fields as needed.

## Q3. What is a document in MongoDB?

A document is a set of `key-value pairs`, similar to JSON objects. Each document is a `record in a collection` and can have **different fields** and **structures** compared to other documents in the same collection.

## Q4. What is a collection in MongoDB?

A collection is a `grouping of MongoDB documents`. Collections are similar to tables in relational databases but without a fixed schema. **Documents within a collection can have different fields**.

## Q5. What is the role of the _id (ObjectID) field in MongoDB?

The `_id` field is a `unique identifier` for each document in a MongoDB collection. It ensures that each document can be uniquely identified and retrieved. By default, MongoDB creates an ObjectId as the value for the `_id` field if it's not provided by the user.

## Q6. How do you insert a document into a MongoDB collection? Provide an example.

You can insert a document into a MongoDB collection using the `insertOne` or `insertMany` methods.

```javascript
db.collectionName.insertOne({
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  occupation: "Software Developer"
});
```

## Q7. What are the different types of indexes in MongoDB?

| Index Type | Description | Code Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Single-field index** | Creates an index on a single field of a document. Useful for sorting and querying based on that field. | `db.collection.createIndex({ fieldName: 1 })` |
| **Compound index** | Creates an index on multiple fields of a document. Improves query performance for complex queries involving multiple fields. | `db.collection.createIndex({ field1: 1, field2: -1 })` |
| **Text index** | Creates an index on text content within a document. Enables full-text search and querying based on text content. | `db.collection.createIndex({ fieldName: "text" })` |
| **Geospatial index** | Creates an index for geographical data (points, lines, polygons). Optimizes queries based on location. | `db.collection.createIndex({ location: "2dsphere" })` |
| **Hashed index** | Creates a hashed index on a single field. Useful for evenly distributing data across buckets. | `db.collection.createIndex({ fieldName: "hashed" })` |
| **TTL index** | Automatically expires documents after a specified time. Useful for managing time-sensitive data. | `db.collection.createIndex({ expirationDate: 1 }, { expireAfterSeconds: 3600 })` |

```javascript
//create an index
db.collectionName.createIndex({ name: 1 });
```

> Indexes are data structures that improve query performance by creating an ordered list of values for one or more fields. They help MongoDB find specific documents more efficiently.
