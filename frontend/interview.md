## 🚀 Final Tips:

* **Tailor your projects** (especially FinDiro or AI Scheduler) to mention things like:

  * Zustand for state
  * Tailwind CSS + Atomic design
  * Dynamic routing in Next.js
  * AWS deployment (S3/CloudFront)
  * SEO Optimization (Next.js `Head`, LCP/FID fixes)
* Review **core web vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS — how to debug using Lighthouse.
* Know your **build tools**: Webpack vs Vite differences.
* Be clear on **testing coverage** and mocking APIs in unit tests.
