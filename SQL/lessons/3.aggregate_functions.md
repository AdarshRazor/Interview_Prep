# SQL Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. These functions are essential for data analysis and reporting in SQL.

## Common Aggregate Functions

### 1. COUNT()

* **Purpose:** Counts the number of rows or non-null values in a column.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    -- Count all rows
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;
    
    -- Count non-null values in a column
    SELECT COUNT(column_name) FROM table_name;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Count total number of employees
    SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees
    FROM Employees;

    -- Count employees in each department
    SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as DepartmentCount
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

### 2. SUM()

* **Purpose:** Calculates the total sum of numeric values in a column.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM table_name;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Calculate total salary budget
    SELECT SUM(Salary) as TotalSalary
    FROM Employees;

    -- Calculate total salary by department
    SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) as DepartmentBudget
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

### 3. AVG()

* **Purpose:** Calculates the average (mean) of numeric values in a column.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Calculate average salary across company
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(Salary), 2) as AverageSalary
    FROM Employees;

    -- Calculate average salary by department
    SELECT Department,
           ROUND(AVG(Salary), 2) as AvgDepartmentSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

### 4. MAX()

* **Purpose:** Finds the maximum value in a column.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM table_name;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Find highest salary in company
    SELECT MAX(Salary) as HighestSalary
    FROM Employees;

    -- Find highest salary in each department
    SELECT Department, MAX(Salary) as HighestSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

### 5. MIN()

* **Purpose:** Finds the minimum value in a column.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Find lowest salary in company
    SELECT MIN(Salary) as LowestSalary
    FROM Employees;

    -- Find lowest salary in each department
    SELECT Department, MIN(Salary) as LowestSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

## Combining Aggregate Functions

* **Purpose:** Multiple aggregate functions can be used together for comprehensive analysis.
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Comprehensive salary analysis by department
    SELECT 
        Department,
        COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount,
        ROUND(AVG(Salary), 2) as AverageSalary,
        SUM(Salary) as TotalSalary,
        MAX(Salary) as HighestSalary,
        MIN(Salary) as LowestSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

## Practical Session ðŸ”´

```sql
-- Let's analyze our employee data

-- Basic counts
SELECT COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees,
       COUNT(DISTINCT Department) as NumberOfDepartments
FROM Employees;

-- Salary statistics by department
SELECT 
    Department,
    COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount,
    ROUND(AVG(Salary), 2) as AverageSalary,
    SUM(Salary) as DepartmentBudget,
    MAX(Salary) as HighestSalary,
    MIN(Salary) as LowestSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
ORDER BY DepartmentBudget DESC;

-- Find departments with average salary above company average
SELECT Department,
       ROUND(AVG(Salary), 2) as DeptAvgSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING AVG(Salary) > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees);
```

Aggregate functions are powerful tools for data analysis in SQL. They allow you to:
- Calculate totals with `SUM`
- Find averages with `AVG`
- Get counts with `COUNT`
- Find maximum values with `MAX`
- Find minimum values with `MIN`

Combining these functions with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses enables complex data analysis and reporting capabilities.
