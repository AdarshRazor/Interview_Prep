# Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

This lesson covers advanced SQL concepts: subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), which are essential for writing complex, efficient, and maintainable queries.

## Subqueries

Subqueries (nested queries) are queries embedded within another query. They can be used in different parts of a SQL statement.

### Subqueries in WHERE Clause

Subqueries in WHERE clauses filter results based on a nested query's results.

```sql
-- Find books borrowed more than average
SELECT Title, BorrowCount
FROM Books
WHERE BorrowCount > (
    SELECT AVG(BorrowCount)
    FROM Books
);

-- Find members who have borrowed books in the last month
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Members
WHERE MemberID IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT MemberID
    FROM Loans
    WHERE LoanDate >= DATEADD(month, -1, GETDATE())
);
```

### Subqueries in SELECT Clause

Subqueries in SELECT statements can compute values for each row.

```sql
-- Show each book's borrow count and its difference from average
SELECT 
    Title,
    BorrowCount,
    BorrowCount - (
        SELECT AVG(BorrowCount) 
        FROM Books
    ) as DifferenceFromAverage
FROM Books;

-- Calculate percentage of total loans for each member
SELECT 
    m.FirstName,
    m.LastName,
    COUNT(l.LoanID) as LoanCount,
    (COUNT(l.LoanID) * 100.0) / (
        SELECT COUNT(*) 
        FROM Loans
    ) as PercentageOfTotal
FROM Members m
LEFT JOIN Loans l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
GROUP BY m.MemberID, m.FirstName, m.LastName;
```

### Subqueries in FROM Clause

Subqueries in FROM clauses create derived tables that can be queried like regular tables.

```sql
-- Calculate average loans per active member
SELECT AVG(LoanCount) as AvgLoansPerMember
FROM (
    SELECT 
        MemberID,
        COUNT(LoanID) as LoanCount
    FROM Loans
    GROUP BY MemberID
) as MemberLoans;

-- Find books with above-average ratings in each category
SELECT b.Title, b.Category, b.Rating
FROM Books b
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT 
        Category,
        AVG(Rating) as AvgRating
    FROM Books
    GROUP BY Category
) as CategoryAvg
ON b.Category = CategoryAvg.Category
WHERE b.Rating > CategoryAvg.AvgRating;
```

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs provide a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query. They make complex queries more readable and maintainable.

### Basic CTE Syntax

```sql
WITH CTE_Name AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM Table
    WHERE condition
)
SELECT *
FROM CTE_Name;
```

### Practical CTE Examples

```sql
-- Calculate member borrowing statistics
WITH MemberStats AS (
    SELECT 
        m.MemberID,
        m.FirstName,
        m.LastName,
        COUNT(l.LoanID) as LoanCount,
        AVG(DATEDIFF(day, l.LoanDate, l.ReturnDate)) as AvgLoanDuration
    FROM Members m
    LEFT JOIN Loans l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
    GROUP BY m.MemberID, m.FirstName, m.LastName
)
SELECT *
FROM MemberStats
WHERE LoanCount > 0
ORDER BY LoanCount DESC;

-- Find popular book categories by age group
WITH MemberAgeGroups AS (
    SELECT 
        MemberID,
        CASE 
            WHEN Age < 20 THEN 'Teen'
            WHEN Age BETWEEN 20 AND 30 THEN 'Young Adult'
            WHEN Age BETWEEN 31 AND 50 THEN 'Adult'
            ELSE 'Senior'
        END as AgeGroup
    FROM Members
),
CategoryLoans AS (
    SELECT 
        mag.AgeGroup,
        b.Category,
        COUNT(*) as LoanCount
    FROM MemberAgeGroups mag
    JOIN Loans l ON mag.MemberID = l.MemberID
    JOIN Books b ON l.BookID = b.BookID
    GROUP BY mag.AgeGroup, b.Category
)
SELECT 
    AgeGroup,
    Category,
    LoanCount,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY AgeGroup ORDER BY LoanCount DESC) as Rank
FROM CategoryLoans
WHERE LoanCount > 10
ORDER BY AgeGroup, LoanCount DESC;
```

### Multiple CTEs

```sql
-- Analyze book popularity and availability
WITH BookLoans AS (
    SELECT 
        BookID,
        COUNT(*) as LoanCount
    FROM Loans
    GROUP BY BookID
),
BookAvailability AS (
    SELECT 
        BookID,
        CASE 
            WHEN CurrentStock > 5 THEN 'High'
            WHEN CurrentStock > 0 THEN 'Low'
            ELSE 'Out of Stock'
        END as Availability
    FROM Books
)
SELECT 
    b.Title,
    bl.LoanCount,
    ba.Availability
FROM Books b
JOIN BookLoans bl ON b.BookID = bl.BookID
JOIN BookAvailability ba ON b.BookID = ba.BookID
ORDER BY bl.LoanCount DESC;
```

## Best Practices

1. **Subquery Guidelines:**
   * Use meaningful aliases
   * Keep subqueries focused and simple
   * Consider performance implications
   * Use CTEs for complex subqueries

2. **CTE Best Practices:**
   * Use descriptive names
   * Break complex queries into logical parts
   * Consider using multiple CTEs for clarity
   * Don't overuse - simple queries don't need CTEs

## Exercise ðŸ”´

```sql
-- Create sample tables
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(50),
    Location VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Departments VALUES
(1, 'IT', 'New York'),
(2, 'HR', 'London'),
(3, 'Finance', 'Tokyo');

INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 1, 75000),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 1, 85000),
(3, 'Bob Johnson', 2, 65000),
(4, 'Alice Brown', 3, 90000);

-- Tasks:
-- 1. Write a query using a subquery to find employees who earn more than
--    their department's average salary

-- 2. Create a CTE to rank departments by average salary and show
--    employees in the top-paying department

-- 3. Use multiple CTEs to analyze salary distribution across locations

-- Solutions:

-- 1. Employees above department average
SELECT 
    e.Name,
    e.Salary,
    d.DepartmentName
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
WHERE e.Salary > (
    SELECT AVG(Salary)
    FROM Employees e2
    WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
);

-- 2. Top-paying department employees
WITH DeptRanking AS (
    SELECT 
        d.DepartmentID,
        d.DepartmentName,
        AVG(e.Salary) as AvgSalary,
        RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AVG(e.Salary) DESC) as SalaryRank
    FROM Departments d
    JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY d.DepartmentID, d.DepartmentName
)
SELECT 
    e.Name,
    e.Salary,
    dr.DepartmentName,
    dr.AvgSalary
FROM Employees e
JOIN DeptRanking dr ON e.DepartmentID = dr.DepartmentID
WHERE dr.SalaryRank = 1;

-- 3. Salary distribution by location
WITH LocationStats AS (
    SELECT 
        d.Location,
        MIN(e.Salary) as MinSalary,
        MAX(e.Salary) as MaxSalary,
        AVG(e.Salary) as AvgSalary
    FROM Departments d
    JOIN Employees e ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
    GROUP BY d.Location
),
SalaryCategories AS (
    SELECT
        e.Name,
        e.Salary,
        d.Location,
        CASE
            WHEN e.Salary > ls.AvgSalary THEN 'Above Average'
            WHEN e.Salary = ls.AvgSalary THEN 'Average'
            ELSE 'Below Average'
        END as SalaryCategory
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
    JOIN LocationStats ls ON d.Location = ls.Location
)
SELECT *
FROM SalaryCategories
ORDER BY Location, Salary DESC;
```

This exercise demonstrates:

- Creating CTEs for complex data transformations
- Combining multiple CTEs for detailed analysis
- Practical application of window functions with CTEs
