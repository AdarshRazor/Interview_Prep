# Advanced SQL Query Clauses

Building on our knowledge of basic CRUD operations, let's explore the powerful clauses that help us filter, sort, and analyze data more effectively in SQL.

## 1. WHERE Clause (Filtering Data)

* **Purpose:** To filter rows based on specified conditions.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
* **Common Operators:**
    * Comparison: `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
    * Logical: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`
    * Pattern Matching: `LIKE`, `IN`, `BETWEEN`
* **Example:** Using our Employees table:
    ```sql
    -- Find employees with salary greater than 65000
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Salary > 65000;

    -- Find employees in HR or IT departments
    SELECT *
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Department IN ('HR', 'IT');

    -- Find employees with names starting with 'A'
    SELECT *
    FROM Employees
    WHERE FirstName LIKE 'A%';
    ```

## 2. ORDER BY Clause (Sorting Data)

* **Purpose:** To sort the result set based on one or more columns.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    [WHERE condition]
    ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Sort employees by salary in descending order
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    ORDER BY Salary DESC;

    -- Sort by department first, then by salary
    SELECT *
    FROM Employees
    ORDER BY Department ASC, Salary DESC;
    ```

## 3. LIMIT Clause (Restricting Results)

* **Purpose:** To limit the number of rows returned in the result set.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table_name
    [WHERE condition]
    [ORDER BY column1, column2, ...]
    LIMIT number;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Get the top 3 highest-paid employees
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
    FROM Employees
    ORDER BY Salary DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

## 4. GROUP BY Clause (Grouping Data)

* **Purpose:** To group rows that have the same values in specified columns.
* **Common Aggregate Functions:**
    * `COUNT()`: Count number of rows
    * `SUM()`: Calculate sum
    * `AVG()`: Calculate average
    * `MAX()`: Find maximum value
    * `MIN()`: Find minimum value
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
    FROM table_name
    [WHERE condition]
    GROUP BY column1;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Calculate average salary by department
    SELECT Department, 
           COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount,
           AVG(Salary) as AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department;
    ```

## 5. HAVING Clause (Filtering Groups)

* **Purpose:** To filter groups based on aggregate conditions (similar to WHERE but for grouped data).
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
    FROM table_name
    [WHERE condition]
    GROUP BY column1
    HAVING aggregate_condition;
    ```
* **Example:**
    ```sql
    -- Find departments with average salary > 70000
    SELECT Department, 
           AVG(Salary) as AvgSalary
    FROM Employees
    GROUP BY Department
    HAVING AVG(Salary) > 70000;
    ```

## Practical Session ðŸ”´

```sql
-- Let's add more sample data first
INSERT INTO Employees VALUES
(104, 'David', 'Brown', 'IT', 72000.00),
(105, 'Emma', 'Davis', 'HR', 58000.00),
(106, 'Frank', 'Miller', 'Development', 80000.00),
(107, 'Grace', 'Wilson', 'IT', 68000.00);

-- Find all IT employees earning more than 70000
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'IT' AND Salary > 70000;

-- Sort employees by department and salary
SELECT *
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Department ASC, Salary DESC;

-- Get department statistics
SELECT 
    Department,
    COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount,
    ROUND(AVG(Salary), 2) as AvgSalary,
    MAX(Salary) as MaxSalary,
    MIN(Salary) as MinSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Find top 3 earners
SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

These advanced query clauses are essential for data analysis and reporting in SQL. They allow you to:
- Filter data precisely using `WHERE`
- Sort results meaningfully with `ORDER BY`
- Limit result sets using `LIMIT`
- Perform aggregate analysis with `GROUP BY`
- Filter grouped results using `HAVING`

Combining these clauses gives you powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis in SQL.
