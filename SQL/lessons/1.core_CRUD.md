# Core CRUD

# Basic SQL CRUD Operations Explained

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**. These are the fundamental actions you perform on data within a database table.

While `CREATE TABLE` isn't technically part of *data* CRUD (it creates the *structure*, not the data itself), it's the essential first step. The 'Read' part of CRUD is handled by the `SELECT` statement.

Here's a breakdown:

## 1. `CREATE TABLE` (Setting up the Structure)

* **Purpose:** To define a new table in your database. You specify the table's name and the columns it will contain, along with the data type for each column (e.g., text, number, date) and any constraints (like whether a value is required or must be unique).
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE table_name (
        column1_name data_type constraints,
        column2_name data_type constraints,
        ...
        columnN_name data_type constraints
    );
    ```
* **Example:** Create a simple table to store information about employees.
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Employees (
        EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Unique identifier for each employee, cannot be null
        FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- Employee's first name, up to 50 characters, cannot be null
        LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- Employee's last name, up to 50 characters, cannot be null
        Department VARCHAR(50),       -- Department name, up to 50 characters (can be null)
        Salary DECIMAL(10, 2)         -- Salary, allowing up to 10 digits total, with 2 after the decimal point
    );
    ```
    * `INT`: Integer (whole number).
    * `VARCHAR(n)`: Variable-length string (text) up to `n` characters.
    * `DECIMAL(p, s)`: Exact decimal number with precision `p` (total digits) and scale `s` (digits after decimal).
    * `PRIMARY KEY`: Constraint ensuring `EmployeeID` is unique for each row and cannot be empty (`NULL`).
    * `NOT NULL`: Constraint ensuring a value must be provided for this column.

## 2. `INSERT INTO` (Create Data)

* **Purpose:** To add new rows (records) of data into an existing table. This is the 'Create' part of CRUD for *data*.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    -- Option 1: Specify columns and values (recommended for clarity)
    INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...)
    VALUES (value1, value2, ...);

    -- Option 2: If providing values for ALL columns in their defined order
    INSERT INTO table_name
    VALUES (value1_for_col1, value2_for_col2, ...);
    ```
* **Example:** Add two employees to our `Employees` table.
    ```sql
    -- Using Option 1 (specifying columns)
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
    VALUES (101, 'Alice', 'Smith', 'HR', 60000.00);

    -- Using Option 2 (assuming order: EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
    INSERT INTO Employees
    VALUES (102, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'IT', 75000.50);

    -- Inserting another employee, leaving Department null
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary)
    VALUES (103, 'Charlie', 'Williams', 55000.00);
    ```
    * Notice that string values like names and departments are enclosed in single quotes (`'`).
    * Numbers are not quoted.
    * If a column allows `NULL` (like `Department`) and you don't provide a value (like for Charlie), it will be stored as `NULL` (unknown/missing).

## 3. `UPDATE` (Update Data)

* **Purpose:** To modify existing data in one or more rows within a table. This is the 'Update' part of CRUD.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = new_value1,
        column2 = new_value2,
        ...
    WHERE condition; -- VERY IMPORTANT! Specifies which row(s) to update.
    ```
* **WARNING:** **If you forget the `WHERE` clause, the `UPDATE` statement will modify ALL rows in the table! Always be careful and specify which rows you intend to change.**
* **Example:** Give Alice a raise and move Bob to the 'Development' department.
    ```sql
    -- Update Alice's salary (EmployeeID 101)
    UPDATE Employees
    SET Salary = 65000.00
    WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

    -- Update Bob's department (EmployeeID 102)
    UPDATE Employees
    SET Department = 'Development'
    WHERE EmployeeID = 102;
    ```
    * The `WHERE` clause identifies the specific row(s) based on a condition (in this case, matching the `EmployeeID`).

## 4. `DELETE` (Delete Data)

* **Purpose:** To remove one or more existing rows (records) from a table. This is the 'Delete' part of CRUD.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition; -- VERY IMPORTANT! Specifies which row(s) to delete.
    ```
* **WARNING:** **Just like `UPDATE`, if you forget the `WHERE` clause, the `DELETE` statement will remove ALL rows from the table! Be extremely cautious.**
* **Example:** Assume Charlie leaves the company.
    ```sql
    -- Delete the employee with EmployeeID 103
    DELETE FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = 103;
    ```
    * The `WHERE` clause ensures only the row matching `EmployeeID = 103` is removed.

## Bonus: `SELECT` (Read Data)

* **Purpose:** To retrieve (read) data from one or more tables. This is the 'Read' part of CRUD and how you view the results of your other operations.
* **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ... -- Or use * to select all columns
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition; -- Optional: filters which rows to retrieve
    ```
* **Example:** See the current state of our `Employees` table after the previous operations.
    ```sql
    -- Select all columns (*) for all remaining employees
    SELECT * FROM Employees;

    -- Select only FirstName and Department for employees in Development
    SELECT FirstName, Department
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Department = 'Development';
    ```

These operations (`INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`), along with `CREATE TABLE`, form the foundation of interacting with data in relational databases using SQL.

## Practical Session ðŸ”´

```SQL
-- First employee: Adding Alice to HR department with initial salary
-- Using explicit column names for clarity
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
VALUES (101, 'Alice', 'Smith', 'HR', 60000.00);


-- Second employee: Adding Bob to IT department
-- Using implicit column order (must match table definition exactly)
INSERT INTO Employees
VALUES (102, 'Bob', 'Johnson', 'IT', 75000.50);


-- Third employee: Adding Charlie without specifying department
-- Department will be NULL since it's not included in the column list
INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary)
VALUES (103, 'Charlie', 'Williams', 55000.00);


-- Giving Alice a raise: Update salary for specific employee
-- Using WHERE clause to ensure we only update Alice's record
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 65000.00 
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;


-- Moving Bob to a different department
-- Using WHERE clause to target only Bob's record
UPDATE Employees
SET Department = 'Development'
WHERE EmployeeID = 102;


-- Removing Charlie's record from the database
-- Using WHERE clause to ensure we only delete Charlie's record
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 103;

-- Viewing all employee records after our changes
-- Shows current state of the table
SELECT * FROM Employees;


-- Filtering to show only employees in Development department
-- Demonstrates how to query specific columns with conditions
SELECT FirstName, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Development';
```
