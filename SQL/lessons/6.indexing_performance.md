# Database Indexing and Performance Optimization

This lesson covers database indexing and query performance optimization techniques, essential skills for efficient database operations.

## Database Indexes

Indexes are special data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations in a database. They work similarly to a book's index, providing quick access to specific data without scanning the entire table.

### Types of Indexes

1. **Single-Column Index**
   * Created on one column
   * Useful for queries that filter or sort by that column

```sql
-- Create a simple index on LastName
CREATE INDEX idx_members_lastname
ON Members(LastName);
```

2. **Composite Index**
   * Created on multiple columns
   * Useful for queries that filter by multiple columns

```sql
-- Create a composite index on FirstName and LastName
CREATE INDEX idx_members_fullname
ON Members(FirstName, LastName);
```

3. **Unique Index**
   * Ensures no duplicate values in the indexed column(s)
   * Automatically created for PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints

```sql
-- Create a unique index on Email
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_members_email
ON Members(Email);
```

### When to Use Indexes

1. **DO Create Indexes When:**
   * Column is frequently used in WHERE clauses
   * Column is used in JOIN conditions
   * Column is used in ORDER BY or GROUP BY
   * Column has high selectivity (many unique values)

2. **DON'T Create Indexes When:**
   * Table is small
   * Column has low selectivity
   * Column is frequently updated
   * Column is rarely used in queries

## Using EXPLAIN for Query Analysis

EXPLAIN is a powerful tool that shows how the database executes a query, helping identify performance bottlenecks.

### Basic EXPLAIN Usage

```sql
-- Basic EXPLAIN syntax
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Members WHERE LastName = 'Smith';
```

### Understanding EXPLAIN Output

```sql
-- Create sample tables and data
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email ON Customers(Email);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Customers VALUES
(1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com'),
(2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com');

-- Compare queries with and without index
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Email = 'john@example.com';
-- Output shows index scan (efficient)

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Name = 'John Smith';
-- Output shows table scan (less efficient)
```

### Common EXPLAIN Components

1. **Scan Types**
   * Table Scan (full table scan)
   * Index Scan (using an index)
   * Index Seek (using index to find specific rows)

2. **Cost Information**
   * Relative cost of the operation
   * Higher numbers indicate more resource usage

## Performance Optimization Examples

### Example 1: Optimizing a Simple Query

```sql
-- Before optimization (no index)
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM Books
WHERE PublicationYear > 2000;

-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_books_year
ON Books(PublicationYear);

-- After optimization (with index)
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM Books
WHERE PublicationYear > 2000;
```

### Example 2: Optimizing a JOIN Query

```sql
-- Before optimization
EXPLAIN
SELECT m.FirstName, m.LastName, COUNT(l.LoanID) as LoanCount
FROM Members m
LEFT JOIN Loans l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
GROUP BY m.MemberID, m.FirstName, m.LastName;

-- Create index for JOIN
CREATE INDEX idx_loans_member
ON Loans(MemberID);

-- After optimization
EXPLAIN
SELECT m.FirstName, m.LastName, COUNT(l.LoanID) as LoanCount
FROM Members m
LEFT JOIN Loans l ON m.MemberID = l.MemberID
GROUP BY m.MemberID, m.FirstName, m.LastName;
```

## Best Practices for Index Management

1. **Regular Maintenance**
   * Rebuild or reorganize fragmented indexes
   * Remove unused indexes
   * Monitor index usage

2. **Index Design Guidelines**
   * Keep indexes narrow (fewer columns)
   * Consider column order in composite indexes
   * Balance between read and write performance

3. **Common Pitfalls**
   * Over-indexing (too many indexes)
   * Under-indexing (missing important indexes)
   * Wrong column order in composite indexes

## Exercise ðŸ”´

```sql
-- Create a table for an online store
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Category VARCHAR(50),
    Price DECIMAL(10,2),
    Stock INT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO Products VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 'Electronics', 999.99, 50),
(2, 'Smartphone', 'Electronics', 599.99, 100),
(3, 'Headphones', 'Electronics', 99.99, 200),
(4, 'Book', 'Books', 19.99, 500);

-- Tasks:
-- 1. Create appropriate indexes for the following queries:
--    - Find products by category
--    - Find products by price range
--    - Find products with low stock

-- 2. Use EXPLAIN to compare performance before and after creating indexes

-- 3. Write and analyze a query that uses multiple indexes

-- Solutions:

-- 1. Creating appropriate indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_products_category ON Products(Category);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_price ON Products(Price);
CREATE INDEX idx_products_stock ON Products(Stock);

-- 2. Compare performance
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Category = 'Electronics';
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 500 AND 1000;
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Stock < 100;

-- 3. Query using multiple conditions
EXPLAIN
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE Category = 'Electronics'
  AND Price < 1000
  AND Stock > 0
ORDER BY Price DESC;
```
