# 100 Node Questions (REST API - Basics)

## Q1. What is REST & RESTful API? `V.IMP.`

* REST (Representation State Transfer) is an `architectural style` for designing networked application (REST is a set of `guidelines` for creating APIs).

* RESTful API is a service which follow REST principles/guidelines.

## Q2. What are HTTP Request and Response structures in UI and REST API?

| Feature | HTTP Request | HTTP Response |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | A message sent by a client (such as a web browser or mobile app) to a server, requesting a particular action or resource. | A message sent by a server back to the client in response to an HTTP request. |
| Components | HTTP Action (GET, POST, ...), URL, Request Body, Request Header | Status code, content type, content |

### HTTP Request
```JSON
POST /user/submit-form/HTTP/1.1 //HTTP action & URL
Host: ui-server.example.com //Type of Request
uid=john&password=123 //UI Server Address
Header, Content-Type: application/ //Request Body
```

### HTTP Response
```JSON
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json;
{
    "userId": 123,
    "message": "User created"
}
```

## Q3. What are Top 5 REST guidelines and the advantages of them?

| Principle | Description | Advantage |
|---|---|---|
| **Separation of Client & Server** | The implementation of the client and the server must be done independently. | Independence allows `easier maintenance, scalability, and evolution.` |
| **Stateless** | The server will not store anything about the latest HTTP request the client made. | It will treat every request as new request. It `simplifies` server implementation as it is not overloading it with state management. |
| **Uniform interface** | Identify the resources by URL (e.g., _www.abc.com/api/questions_). | Standardized URLs, making it `easy to understand` and use the API. |
| **Cacheable** | The API response should be cacheable to improve the performance. | Caching API responses `improves performance` by reducing the need for repeated requests to the server. |
| **Layered system** | The system should follow layered pattern. | A layered system, such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, promotes `modular design` and separation of concerns. |

## Q4. What is the difference between REST API and SOAP API?

| Feature | REST API | SOAP API |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | REST is an architectural style. | SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol. |
| **Protocol** | Uses HTTP or HTTPS. | Can use various protocols (HTTP, SMTP, etc.). |
| **Message Format** | Uses lightweight formats like JSON, XML. | Typically uses XML. |
| **State** | Stateless. | Can be stateful or stateless. |
| **Error Handling** | Relies on HTTP status codes. | Defines its own fault mechanism. |
| **Performance** | Generally lightweight and faster. üèÜ | Can be slower due to XML processing. |
