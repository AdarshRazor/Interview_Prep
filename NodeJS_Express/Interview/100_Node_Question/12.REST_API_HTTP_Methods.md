# 100 Node Questions (REST API - HTTP Methods & Status Codes)

## Q1. What are HTTP Verbs and HTTP methods? `V.IMP.`

HTTP methods, also known as HTTp verbs, are a set of actions that a client can take on a resource.

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* PATCH

## Q2. What are GET, POST, PUT & DELETE HTTP methods?

| HTTP Method | Action                                   | Example                               |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **GET**     | Retrieve data from a specified resource  | www.example.com/users <br> (retrieve users list) <br> www.example.com/users/123 <br> (retrieve single user of id - 123) |
| **POST**    | Submit data to be processed              | www.example.com/users <br> (submit and create a new user from data provided in request) |
| **PUT**     | Update a resource or create a new resource if it does not exist | www.example.com/users/123 <br> (update user 123 details from data provided in request) |
| **DELETE**  | Request removal of a resource            | www.example.com/users/123 <br> (delete user 123) |

## Q3. What is the difference between PUT & PATCH methods?

| PUT                                            | PATCH                                         |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Both PUT and PATCH methods are used to `update a resource` by replacing the resource with the new data provided in the request. |                                               |
| **Full Resource Replacement**: In a PUT request, the client sends the full updated resource in the request body, replacing the existing resource on the server. | **Partial Updates**: In a PATCH request, the client sends specific changes or instructions for modifying the resource, updating only certain fields without resending the entire resource. |


```javascript
// PUT URL: www.example.com/users/123 [invalid URL removed]
// PUT request body
{
"id": 123,
"name": "John Doe Updated",
"email": "john@example.com",
"age": 26
}
```

```javascript
// PATCH URL: www.example.com/users/123 [invalid URL removed]
// PATCH request body
{
"email": "john@example.com",
"age": 26
}
```

## Q4. Explain the concept of Idempotence in RESTful APIs.

Idempotence meaning performing an operation multiple times should have the same outcome as performing it once. 

For example, Sending multiple indentical GET requests will always return the same response.

### Idempotent Methods
* GET
* PUT
* DELTE

### Non-Idempotent Methods
* POST

## Q5. What are the role of status codes in RESTful APIs?

Status codes are used to convey the results of a client's request.

| 1XX (Info)          | 2XX (Success)              | 3XX (Redirection)       | 4XX (Client Error)               | 5XX (Server Error)              |
|---------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 100: Continue       | 200: OK                    | 300: Multiple Choices   | 400: Bad Request                 | 500: Internal Server Error      |
|                     | 201: Created               |                         | 401: Unauthorized                | 501: Not Implemented            |
|                     | 202: Accepted              |                         | 403: Forbidden                   | 502: Bad Gateway                |
|                     | 204: No Content            |                         | 404: Not Found                   | 503: Service Unavailable        |
