# 100 Node Questions (REST API - Authentication & Authorization)

## Q1. What are Authentication and Authorization?

* **Authentication** is the process of verifying a user's identity by checking their credentials like username and password.

* **Authorization** is the process of deciding if an authenticated user can access specific resources.

    > Authentication always happens before authorization.

## Q2. What are the types of authentication in Node.js?

* Basic (Username and Password) Authentication
* API Key Authentication
* Token-based Authentication **(JWT)**
* Multi-factor Authentication **(MFA)**
* Certificate-based Authentication

## Q3. What is Basic Authentication?

In Basic Authentication, the user passes their credentials on a post request. At the Node Rest API end, credentials are verified, and response is sent back.

The disadvantage of it is, Basic Authentication sends credentials in plain text over the network, so it is not considered a secure method of authentication.

## Q4. What are the security risks associated with storing passwords in plain text in Node.js?

* `Unauthorized Access`: Storing passwords in plain text means that anyone with access to the storage location, such as a database or configuration file, can easily read and extract passwords.

* `Compromise of Other Accounts`: Many users tend to reuse passwords across multiple accounts, allowing attackers to access multiple accounts.

## Q5. What is the role of Hashing and Salt in securing passwords?

`Hasing:` Hashing is a process of converting a password into a fixed-size string of characters using a `mathematical algorithm`.

## Q6. How can we securely hash passwords in Node.js?

### Steps to Hash and Salt a Password

1. **Generate a random salt**
2. **Create a hash object using SHA-256**
3. **Update the hash object with the salt and password**
4. **Get the hashed data in a hexadecimal string**
5. **Return the salt and hashed password as a string**

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

// Define a function to hash and salt a password
function hashAndSaltPassword(password) {
    // 1. Generate a random salt
    const salt = crypto.randomBytes(16).toString("hex");

    // 2. Create a hash object using SHA-256
    const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");

    // 3. Update the hash object with the salt and password
    hash.update(salt + password);

    // 4. Get the hashed data in a hexadecimal string
    const hexHash = hash.digest("hex");

    // 5. Return the salt and hashed password as a string
    return salt + ":" + hexHash;
}

// Output: 8b18c67adab66e2d597ea0c036faa02b:3fdaf32ff5f8...
```

## Q7. What is API Key Authentication?

`API Key Authentication` - In API Key Authentication, the  API owner will share an API key with the users and this key with the users and this key will authenticate the users of the API.

The disadvantage of it is, API keys can be shared or stolen therefore it may not be suitable for all scenarios.

## Q8. What is Token-based and JWT authentication? `V.IMP.`

### Token-based authentication 
It is a process by which clients `exchange their credentials` (such as username and password) for a `token`. This token is then used to `authenticate subsequent requests`. One of the most common implementations of token-based authentication is `JSON Web Token (JWT)`.

* Process:
    * The client sends their credentials to the server.
    * The server validates the credentials.
    * Upon successful validation, the server generates a token and sends it to the client.
    * The client stores the token and includes it in the header of subsequent requests.
    * The server verifies the token and processes the request if the token is valid.

### JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication 
It is a method for securely `transmitting` information between parties as a `JSON object`. This information can be `verified and trusted` because it is digitally signed. JWTs are commonly used for `authentication and authorization` purposes in web applications.
Key Concepts of JWT Authentication

## Q9. What are the parts of a JWT token?

* JWT Structure:
    * **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm being used (e.g., HMAC SHA256).
    * **Payload**: Contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
    * **Signature**: Ensures the token hasnâ€™t been altered. The signature is created by encoding the header and payload using Base64Url encoding, and then signing them using a secret key or a public/private key pair.

## Q10. Where does a JWT token reside in the request?

In **REQUEST HEADER**
