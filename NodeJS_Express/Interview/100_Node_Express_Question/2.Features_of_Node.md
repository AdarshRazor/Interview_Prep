# 100 Node Questions (Features of Node)

## Q1. What are the 7 Main Features of Node.js?

* Single Threaded
* Asynchronous
* Event-Driven
* V8 JavaScript Engine
* Cross-Platform
* NPM (Node Package Manager)
* Real-Time Capabilities

## Q2. What is Single Threaded Programming?

* Method of execution, where a program runs on a single sequence of instructions, or thread.

* Tasks are processed one at a time, sequentially, without parallel execution. 

* It simplifies the development process but can be less efficient for handling multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Q3. What is Synchronous Programming?

* In a synchronous program, `each task is performed one after the other`, and the program waits for each operation to complete before moving on to the next one.

* Synchronous programming focuses on the order of execution in a sequential manner, while single-threaded programming focuses on the single thread.

## Q4. What is Multi Threaded Programming?

* It allows a program to run multiple threads concurrently, enabling it to perform `several tasks at the same time`.

* This can enhance performance and responsiveness but `adds complexity` in managing shared resources.

## Q5. What is Asynchronous Programming?

* It lets a program start a task and move on to other tasks before the first one finishes. 

* This allows the program to handle multiple operations concurrently `without waiting` for each to complete, making it more `efficient and responsive`.

## Q6. What is the difference between Synchronous & Asynchronous programming?

| Feature | Synchronous Programming | Asynchronous Programming |
|---|---|---|
| Task Execution | Tasks are executed one after another in a sequential manner. | Tasks can start, run, and complete in parallel. |
| Task Dependency | Each task must complete before the program moves on to the next task. | Tasks can be executed independently of each other. üèÜ|
| Code Execution | Execution of code is blocked until a task is finished. | Asynchronous operations are typically non-blocking. üèÜ|
| Impact on Program | Synchronous operations can lead to blocking and unresponsiveness. | It enables better concurrency and responsiveness. üèÜ|

## Q7. What are Events, Event Emitter, Event Queue, Event Loop & Event Driven?

* **Event**: Signals that something has happened in a program.

* **Event Emitter**: Create or emit events.

* **Event Queue**: Events emitted queued(stored) in event queue.

* **Event Handler(Event Listener)**: Function that responds to specific events

* **Event Loop**: The event loop picks up event from the event queue and executes them in the order they were added.

* **Event Driven Architecture**: It means operations in Node are drive or based by events.

## Q8. What are the main features & advantages of Node.js?

| Feature | Advantages |
|---|---|
| **Asynchronous** | Enables handling `multiple concurrent requests` & `non blocking execution` of thread. |
| **V8 JS Engine** | Built on the V8 JS engine from Google Chrome, Node.js `executes code fast`. |
| **Event-Driven Architecture** | `Efficient handling` events, Great for real time applications like chat applications, gaming applications(using web sockets) where bidirectional communication is required. |
| **Cross-Platform** | Supports deployment on various operating systems, `enhancing flexibility`. |
| **JavaScript** | Coding in JS language therefore no need to learn a new language. |
| **Scalability** | Suitable for building `scalable applications` that can handle increased loads. |


## Q9. What are the disadvantages of node?

| When to Use Node.js | When not to use Node.js (disadvantages) |
|---|---|
| Ideal for `real-time applications` like chat applications, online gaming, and collaborative tools due to its event-driven architecture. | `CPU-Intensive Tasks`: Avoid for applications that involve heavy CPU processing(Image/Video Processing, Data Encryption/Decryption,) as Node.js may not provide optimal performance in such scenarios because it single threaded and for heavy computation multi-threaded is better. |
| Excellent for building `lightweight and scalable RESTful APIs` that handle a large number of concurrent connections. |  |
| Well-suited for building `microservices-based architectures`, enabling modular and scalable systems. |  |
