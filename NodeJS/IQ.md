# Node.js Hands-On Project Topics

## 1. Setting Up a Node.js Project

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you initialize a new Node.js project?**
   - **A:** Use the command `npm init` and follow the prompts to create a `package.json` file. Alternatively, use `npm init -y` to automatically generate a `package.json` with default settings.

2. **Q: What is the purpose of the `package.json` file?**
   - **A:** The `package.json` file contains metadata about the project, such as the project name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other configuration options.

3. **Q: How do you install a new package in a Node.js project?**
   - **A:** Use the command `npm install <package-name>` to install a package and add it to the `dependencies` in the `package.json` file.

4. **Q: What is the difference between a local and a global package installation?**
   - **A:** Local packages are installed in the `node_modules` directory of the project and are only available within that project. Global packages are installed system-wide and can be used from any project or command line.

5. **Q: How can you remove a package from your Node.js project?**
   - **A:** Use the command `npm uninstall <package-name>` to remove a package and update the `package.json` file accordingly.

## 2. Creating and Using Modules

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you create a new module in Node.js?**
   - **A:** Create a new JavaScript file and export the desired functions or objects using `module.exports`.

2. **Q: How do you import a module in Node.js?**
   - **A:** Use the `require` function to import the module, e.g., `const myModule = require('./myModule');`.

3. **Q: What is the difference between `module.exports` and `exports` in Node.js?**
   - **A:** `module.exports` is the object that is actually returned as the result of a `require` call, while `exports` is a shorthand to add properties to `module.exports`. If you assign a new value to `exports`, it will no longer reference `module.exports`.

4. **Q: How can you structure your Node.js project to manage multiple modules?**
   - **A:** Organize your project by creating directories for different functionalities, and place related modules in their respective directories. Use an `index.js` file to export all modules from a directory.

5. **Q: How do you handle circular dependencies in Node.js modules?**
   - **A:** Refactor your code to remove the circular dependency by using techniques like dependency injection or breaking the dependency into smaller modules.

## 3. Asynchronous Programming with Callbacks, Promises, and Async/Await

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: What is a callback in Node.js?**
   - **A:** A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is executed after the first function completes its operation.

2. **Q: How do you handle errors in a callback function?**
   - **A:** Use the error-first callback pattern, where the first argument of the callback is an error object, and the subsequent arguments are the result of the operation.

3. **Q: What is a Promise in Node.js?**
   - **A:** A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

4. **Q: How do you convert a function that uses callbacks to return a Promise?**
   - **A:** Wrap the function logic inside a new Promise constructor and use `resolve` and `reject` to handle the success and error cases.

5. **Q: How do you use `async` and `await` to handle asynchronous operations?**
   - **A:** Declare a function as `async` and use `await` to pause the execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected.

## 4. Working with Express.js

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you create a new Express application?**
   - **A:** Install Express using `npm install express` and create an instance of Express by requiring it and calling `express()`.

2. **Q: How do you define a route in Express?**
   - **A:** Use methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, and `app.delete()` to define routes for different HTTP methods.

3. **Q: How do you handle middleware in Express?**
   - **A:** Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request, response, and next middleware function. Use `app.use()` to apply middleware globally or to specific routes.

4. **Q: How do you serve static files in an Express application?**
   - **A:** Use the built-in middleware `express.static` and specify the directory containing the static files, e.g., `app.use(express.static('public'));`.

5. **Q: How do you handle form data and JSON in Express?**
   - **A:** Use the `express.urlencoded({ extended: true })` middleware to handle form data and `express.json()` middleware to handle JSON data.

## 5. Working with Databases

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you connect a Node.js application to a MongoDB database?**
   - **A:** Use the `mongoose` library. Install it using `npm install mongoose`, then use `mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase')` to connect to the database.

2. **Q: How do you define a schema and model in Mongoose?**
   - **A:** Use `const schema = new mongoose.Schema({ ... })` to define a schema, and `const Model = mongoose.model('ModelName', schema)` to create a model.

3. **Q: How do you perform CRUD operations using Mongoose?**
   - **A:** Use Mongoose methods like `Model.create()`, `Model.find()`, `Model.findByIdAndUpdate()`, and `Model.findByIdAndDelete()` to perform CRUD operations.

4. **Q: How do you handle database connection errors in Mongoose?**
   - **A:** Listen for connection events using `mongoose.connection.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'connection error:'))`.

5. **Q: How do you use Mongoose middleware (pre and post hooks)?**
   - **A:** Define middleware functions using `schema.pre('save', function(next) { ... })` for pre-save hooks and `schema.post('save', function(doc) { ... })` for post-save hooks.

## 6. Testing in Node.js

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you set up a testing environment in a Node.js project?**
   - **A:** Install testing libraries like Mocha and Chai using `npm install mocha chai`, and create a `test` directory with test files.

2. **Q: How do you write a basic test using Mocha and Chai?**
   - **A:** Use `describe` to group tests, `it` to define individual test cases, and Chai's `expect` or `assert` to perform assertions.

3. **Q: How do you run your tests using Mocha?**
   - **A:** Add a test script in `package.json` like `"test": "mocha"` and run `npm test` from the command line.

4. **Q: What is the purpose of using a test double (mock, stub, spy)?**
   - **A:** Test doubles are used to simulate the behavior of real objects in a controlled way, allowing you to test parts of your code in isolation.

5. **Q: How do you handle asynchronous tests in Mocha?**
   - **A:** Pass a `done` callback to your test function and call it after your asynchronous operations are complete, or return a Promise from your test function.

## 7. Error Handling and Debugging

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you handle errors in a Node.js application?**
   - **A:** Use try-catch blocks for synchronous code and handle errors in asynchronous code by passing them to callback functions or rejecting Promises.

2. **Q: How do you use the `debug` module in Node.js?**
   - **A:** Install the `debug` module using `npm install debug`, then require and create a debugger instance using `const debug = require('debug')('app')`.

3. **Q: What is the purpose of the `process.on('uncaughtException')` event?**
   - **A:** This event is used to catch and handle uncaught exceptions that may cause the application to crash.

4. **Q: How do you log errors in a Node.js application?**
   - **A:** Use a logging library like `winston` or `morgan` to log errors and other information to the console or a file.

5. **Q: How do you use Node.js's built-in debugger?**
   - **A:** Start your Node.js application with the `--inspect` flag and use a debugger client like Chrome DevTools to set breakpoints and step through your code.

## 8. Security Best Practices

### Questions and Answers:

1. **Q: How do you protect your Node.js application from SQL injection attacks?**
   - **A:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database to avoid directly embedding user input in SQL queries.

2. **Q: How do you handle sensitive data in a Node.js application?**
   - **A:** Use environment variables to store sensitive data like API keys and database credentials, and avoid hardcoding them in your source code.

3. **Q: How do you prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks in a Node.js application?**
   - **A:** Sanitize and escape user input before rendering it in the HTML output to prevent malicious scripts from being executed in the user's browser.

4. **Q: How do you secure your Express application using Helmet?**
   - **A:** Install the `helmet` middleware using `npm install helmet` and use it in your Express application with `app.use(helmet())` to set various HTTP headers for security.

5. **Q: How do you implement rate limiting in a Node.js application?**
   - **A:** Use a middleware like `express-rate-limit` to limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period, protecting against brute-force attacks.
