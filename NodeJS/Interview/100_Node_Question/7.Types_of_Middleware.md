# 100 Node Questions (Express - Types of Middleware)

## Q1. What are the type of middleware's in Express.js? `V. IMP.`

5 Types of middleware

* Application-level 
* Router-Level
* Error-handling
* Built-in
* THird-party

## Q2. What is the difference btw application-level & route-level middleware?

* `Application-level middleware` applies globally to all incoming requests in the entire Express.js application.

* `Route-level middleware` applies only to specific routes, not for all incoming requests.

### Application-level middleware

```javascript
// Application-level middleware
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    // Middleware logic goes here
    res.send("Hello World!");
    next(); // Call the next middleware function
};

app.use(myMiddleware); // Use middleware globally for all routes

const PORT = 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log('Server is running ${PORT}');
});
```

### Route-level middleware

```javascript
// Route-level middleware
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const middleware = (req, res, next) => {
    res.send('Middleware for specific route');
    next();
};

app.use('/example', middleware); // Use middleware globally for specific routes

const PORT = 3000;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log('Server is running ${PORT}');
});
```

## Q3. What is `error handling middleware` and how to implement it?

* Error handling middleware in Express is a special kind of middleware used to `manage errors` happening while handling incoming requests.

* To implement error handling in Express, define middleware with four parameters (err, req, res, next). Here the additional `error object parameter` will be used for error handling.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Middleware generating error
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
        // Simulate an error
        next(new Error("An error occurred"));
    });

    // Error-handling middleware
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        console.error(err.stack);
        res.status(500).send("Something went wrong!");
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

## Q4. If you have 5 middlewares then in which middleware you will do the error handling?

In case of multiple middleware, error-handling middleware should be `defined at last`(after all other middleware's) because when an error occurs, Express.js will search for the next error-handling middleware skipping any regular middleware or route handlers.

```javascript
app.use(middleware);
app.use(middleware);
app.use(middleware);
app.use(middleware);

app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send("Something went wrong!");
})
```

## Q5. What is built in middleware? How to serve static files from Express.js?

* Built in middleware’s are built in functions inside Express framework which provides common functionalities.

* `express.static()` middleware is used for serving static files.

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Serve static files from the 'public' directory
    app.use(express.static("public"));

    // Other routes and middleware can be defined here

    // Start the server
    const PORT = 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server is running on ${PORT}`);
    });
    ```

## Q6. What are third-party middleware's? Give some examples?

* Modules developed by third-party developers (not part of the core Express.js).

* Provide functionalities like logging, security, body parsing, and compression.

* Example of third-party middleware’s: morgan, helmet, body-parser, compression etc.

```javascript
// Third-party middlewares
// npm install helmet body-parser compression

const express = require('express');
const helmet = require('helmet');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const compression = require('compression');
const app = express();

// Use the helmet middleware for setting HTTP security headers
app.use(helmet());

// Use the body-parser middleware for parsing request bodies
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Use the compression middleware for compressing HTTP responses
app.use(compression());
```

## Q7. Can you summarize all the type of middleware's? `V. IMP.`

| Type of Middleware | Description |
|---|---|
| Application-level middleware | Middleware applied to all routes; commonly used for logging, authentication, etc. |
| Router-level middleware | Middleware specific to certain routes; applied using `app.use()`. |
| Built-in middleware | Pre-packaged middleware included with Express.js, like for serving static files. |
| Error-handling middleware | Middleware for handling errors; declared after other middleware, triggered on errors. |
| Third-party middleware | Middleware developed by others, not part of Express.js core; adds various functionalities. |

## Q8. What are the advantages of using middleware in Express.js? `V. IMP.`

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Modularity | Middleware allows you to modularize your application's functionality into smaller, self-contained units. Each middleware function can handle a specific task or concern, such as logging, authentication, or error handling. |
| Reusability | Middlewares can be reused at multiple places and that makes application code easier to maintain. |
| Improved Request Handling | Middleware functions have access to both the request (req) and response (res) objects which enables you to perform validations on request or modify the response before sending it back to the client. |
| Flexible Control Flow | Middleware functions can be applied globally to all routes or selectively to specific routes, allowing you to control the flow of request processing in your application. |
| Third-party Middleware's | Express.js offers a wide range of third-party middleware packages that provide additional functionality. For eg: body-parser, cors etc. |
