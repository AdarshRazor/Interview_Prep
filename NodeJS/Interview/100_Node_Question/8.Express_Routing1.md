## Q3. How to implement routing? How do you define routes in Express.js?
-
* To implement routing first define the routes.

* In Express.js, routes are defined using the app.METHOD() functions. (where METHOD is the HTTP request method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and app is an instance of the Express application).

    ```javascript
    const express = require("express");
    const app = express();

    // Define a route for handling GET requests
    app.get("/", (req, res) => {
        res.send("Interview Happy!"); // Route handler
    });

    // Define a route for handling POST requests
    app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
        // Handle login logic
    });

    // Start the server
    const PORT = 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log('Server is running on ${PORT}');
    });
    ```
