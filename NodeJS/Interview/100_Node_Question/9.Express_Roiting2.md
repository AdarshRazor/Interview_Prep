# 100 Node Questions (Express - Routing 2)

## Q1. What are Router object & Router Methods and how to implement them? `V. IMP.`

* The router object is a mini version of an Express application which is used for `handling routes.`

* Router Methods are function provided by the Router object to define routes for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELTE, etc).

### Implement router method: `router.js`
```javascript
const express = require('express');

//Create router object
const router  = express.Router();

//Define a route for the root URL  ('/')
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello, world!");
})

//Export the router object
module.exports = router;
```

### Use router method
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = require("./router");
const app = express();

//Mount the router object on a path
app.use("/api", router);

//Start the server
app.listen(3000,  () => {
    console.log(`running on port, 3000`)
})
```

## Q2. What are the types of Router Methods?

* router.get(path, callback)

* router.post(path, callback)

* router.put(path, callback)

* router.delete(path, callback)

## Q3. What is the difference between app.get() and router.get() method?

| Feature | app.get() | router.get() |
|---|---|---|
| Definition | Defines routes directly on the application object. | Defines routes on a router object. |
| Mounting | Automatically mounted on the root path (`/`). | Must be explicitly mounted using `app.use()`. |
| Modularity | Not modular, cannot be reused in other applications. | Modular, can be reused by exporting the router object. |

## app-get.js
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Interview Happy");
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running");
});
```

## router.js
```javascript
const express = require("express");
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Interview Happy");
});

module.exports = router;
```

## Q4. What is express.Router() in Express.js?

express.Router is a class in Express.js that returns a new router object.

### router.js
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router  = express.Router();

//Define a route for the root URL  ('/')
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello, world!");
})

//Export the router object
module.exports = router;
```

## Q5. Share a real application use of Routing?

## Q6. What is Route Chaining in Express.js?

## Q7. What is Route Nesting in Express.js?

## Q8. How to implement route nesting in Express.js?
