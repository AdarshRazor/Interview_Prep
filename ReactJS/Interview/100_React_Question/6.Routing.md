# 100 React Questions (Routing)

## Q1. What is Routing and Router in React? `V. IMP.`

### Routing
Routing allows you to create a single-page web application with navigation, without the need for a full-page refresh.

### React Router

React Router is a library for handling routing and enables navigation and rendering of different components based on the URL.

## Q2. How to Implement Routing in React? `V. IMP.`

* Install React-Router
* Create Navigation
* Create Routes

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### Navbar.js
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

// Elements or imported components
const Home = () => <h2>Home</h2>;
const About = () => <h2>About</h2>;
const Contact = () => <h2>Contact</h2>;

const AppRoute = () => (
  <div>
    {/* Navigation links */}
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
```

### index.js
```javascript
import AppRoute from './Others/AppRoute';
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <Router>
    <AppRoute />
  </Router>
);

    {/* Routes */}
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
    </Routes>
  </div>
);

export default AppRoute;
```

## Q3. What are the roles of <Routes> & <Route> component in React Routing? `V. IMP.`

* The <Routes> component is used as the root container for declaring your `collection of routes`.
* The <Route> component is used to define a route and specify the component that should render when the `route matches`.
    * For example, in this code if user enter "websitename.com/about [invalid URL removed]" in url, then matching "About" component will be rendered.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      <Route path="/contact" element={<Contact />} />
    </Routes>
```

## Q4. What are Route Parameters in React Routing?

Route parameters in React Router are a way to pass dynamic values(data)  to the component `as part of the URL path`.

```javascript
{/* userId is the route parameter */}
<Route path="/users/:userId" component={UserProfile}/>
```

## Q5. What is the role of Switch Component in React Routing?

* Switch component ensures that only the `first matching <Route> is rendered` and rest are ignored.
    * For example, Switch is commonly used to handle 404 or "not fount" routes.

```javascript
import {Switch, Route} from 'react-router-dom';
<Switch>
    <Route path="/users" component={UserList}/>
    <Route path="/users/:id" component={UserProfile}/>
</Switch>
```

## Q6. What is the role of exact prop in React Routing?

exact prop is used with the <Route> component to `match exactly` to the provided path.

```javascript
{/*Without exact (default behavior)*/}
{/*Match /about, /about/team, /about/contact, etc.*/}
<Route path="/about" component={About} />
```
```javascript
{/*With exact*/}
{/*Only match /about*/}
<Route path="/about" exact component={About} />
```
