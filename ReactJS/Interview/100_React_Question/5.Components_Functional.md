# 100 React Questions (Components - Functional/Class)

## Q1. What are React Components? What are the main elements of it? `V. IMP.`

In React, a component is a `reusable building block` for creating user interfaces.

```javascript
// 1. Import the React library
import React from 'react';

// 2. Define a functional component
function Component() {
  // 3. Return JSX to describe the component's UI
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>I am a React Reusable Component</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

// 4. Export the component to make it available for use in other files
export default Component;
```

## Q2. What are the Types of React components? What are Functional Components? `V. IMP.`

Types of Components:
* Functional Components
* Class based Components

**Functional Components**

* Functional components are declared as **Javascript function**

* They are `stateless components`, but with the help of hoooks, they can now manage state also.

**Class based Components**

* Class-based components are declared as **Javascript ES6 classes**.

* They are `stateful components`, by using life cycle methods. (meaning they can manage and maintain their own state using this.state.)

* The render method is a class component is responsible for returning JSX.

## Q3. How do you pass data between functional components in React?

**props (properties)** are a way to `pass data` from a parent component to a child component.

```javascript
function App() {
    return (
        <ChildComponent name="Happy" purpose="Interview" />
    );
}
```

```javascript
function ChildComponent(props) {
    return <div>{props.name}, {props.purpose}!</div>;
}
```

## Q4. What is Prop Drilling in React? `V. IMP.`

Prop drilling is the process of passing down props through multiple layers of components.

`Parent Component -> Child Component -> Grand Child Component`
Data is passed down through each component.

### PropParent
```jsx
function PropParent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <PropChild message={'data'} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### PropChild
```jsx
function PropChild({ message }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <PropGrandChild message={message} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### PropGrandChild
```jsx
function PropGrandChild({ message }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{message}</h3>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Q5. Why to Avoid Prop Drilling? In how many ways can avoid Prop Drilling? `V. IMP.`

### Why to avoid Prop Drilling:

1. **Maintenance:** Prop drilling can make code harder to maintain as changes in data flow require updates across multiple components.
2. **Complexity:** It increases code complexity and reduces code readability.
3. **Debugging:** Debugging becomes challenging when props need to be traced through numerous components.

### 5 Ways to avoid Prop Drilling

1. Using Context API
2. Using Redux
3. Using Component Composition
4. Using Callback Functions
5. Using Custom Hooks

## Q6. What are Class Components in React? `V. IMP.`

**Class based Components**

* Class-based components are declared as **Javascript ES6 classes**.

* They are `stateful components`, by using life cycle methods. (meaning they can manage and maintain their own state using this.state.)

* The render method is a class component is responsible for returning JSX.

    ```javascript
    import React, {Components} from 'react';

    class AppClass extends Component {
        render() {
            return <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        }
    }

    export default AppClass;
    ```

## Q7. How to pass data between class components in React?

`this.props` can be used in child component to access properties/data passed from parent component.

```jsx
class ParentComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    const dataToSend = "Hello from Parent!";
    return (
      <div>
        <ChildComponent message={dataToSend} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ParentComponent;
```
```js
class ChildComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Message: {this.props.message}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ChildComponent;
```

## Q8. What is the role of this keyword in class components?

this keyword is used to refer to the `instance of the class`.

## Q9. What are the 5 differences btw Functional components & Class components? `V. IMP.`

### Functional Component vs. Class Component

| Functional Component                             | Class Component                         |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Syntax:** Defined as a JS function.            | **Syntax:** Defined as a JS (ES6) class. |
| **State:** Originally stateless but can now maintain state using hooks. | **State:** Can manage local state with `this.state`. |
| **Lifecycle methods:** No                        | **Lifecycle methods:** Yes              |
| **Readability:** More readable & concise. üèÜ     | **Readability:** Verbose (complex).     |
| **this keyword:** No                           | **this keyword:** Yes (Access props using `this.props`) |
| **Render method:** Do not have render method.    | **Render method:** Have render method.  |
