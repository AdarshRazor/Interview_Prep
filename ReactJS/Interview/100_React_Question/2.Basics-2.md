# 100 React Questions (Basics - 2)

## Q1. What is Arrow Function Expression in JSX? `V. IMP.`

* An Arrow Function Expression is a concise way to write functions. 
* Arrow functions are often used because they do not **bind** their own `this` context, making them more predictable and reducing potential errors related to the `this` keyword.

    ```javascript
    // Arrow Function Expression
    const ArrowFunc = (props) => {
        return (
            <>
                <h1>{props.name}</h1>
            </>
        )
    }

    export default ArrowFunc
    ```

## Q2. How to Setup React first project?

* Install [Node](https://nodejs.org)
* Install code editor [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Command to create project `npx create-reactapp my-app-name`
* Open project folder
* Run `npm start` to start the project

## Q3. What are the Main Files in a React project?

| S.No  | File Name                  | Description                                                                                      |
|----|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | `index.html`               | Single page for React application.                                                               |
| 2  | `Components/component1.js` | Your application components.                                                                     |
| 3  | `App.js`                   | Main component or container or Root component.                                                   |
| 4  | `App.test.js (Optional)`   | Used for writing tests for the App.js file.                                                      |
| 5  | `Index.css (Optional)`     | This is a global CSS file that serves as the main stylesheet for the entire application.         |
| 6  | `index.js`                 | Entry point for JavaScript. Renders the main React component (App) into the root DOM element.    |


## Q4. How React App Load and display the components in browser? `V. IMP.`

* **index.html**
    
    Single page which loads index.js by React libraries

* **index.js**

    Replace root element of index.html file by App component

* **App.js**

    Root component which is the container of all the child components.

* **ChildComponent.js**

    Custom child components placed over app component.

## Q5. What is the difference between React and Angular?

| React                                                                                  | Angular                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **React and Angular both are used to create single page UI applications using components.**   |
| 1. React is a JavaScript library                                                       | 1. Angular is a complete framework.                                                       |
| 2. React uses a `virtual DOM` which makes it faster. 🏆                                | 2. Angular uses a real DOM                                                                |
| 3. React is smaller in size and `lightweight` and therefore faster sometime. 🏆            | 3. Angular is bigger because it is a complete framework.                                  |
| 4. React depends on external libraries for many complex features, so developer has to write many lines of code for complex functionalities.                      | 4. Since Angular is a complete framework, therefore it provides `built-in support` for features like routing, forms, validation, and HTTP requests. 🏆 |
| 5. React is `simple to learn` and more popular than Angular.  🏆                           | 5. Angular is slightly difficult to learn as it has Typescript, OOPS concept and many more things. |


## Q6. What are other 5 JS frameworks other than React?

* Angular (new version)
* Vue.js
* AngularJS (old version)
* Backbone.js 
* Ember.js

## Q7. Whether React is a Framework or a Library? What is the difference?

| Library                                                                                          | Framework                                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Developers import the libraries at the top and then used its functions in components.           | Developers need to follow a specific structure or pattern defined by the framework.            |
| React is commonly referred to as a JavaScript library.                                           | Angular is a framework.                                                                        |

## Q8. How React provides Reusability and Composition? `(advantage of components)`

React provides reusability and composition through its `component-based architecture`.

* **Reusability**: Once you create a component, you can re-use it in different parts of your application or even in multiple projects.

* **Composition**: Composition is creating new and big components by `combining existing small components`. Its advantage is, change to one small component will not impact other components.

## Q9. What are State, Stateless, Stateful and State Management terms?

* `state` refers to the current state of the component.
* `Stateful` or `state management` refers to, when a user performs some actions on the UI, then the Reat application should be able to **update andre-render that data or state** on the UI.

    ```javascript
    import React from 'react';

    // Stateless Example
    function ComponentState() {
    let count = 0; // Initial state

    const increment = () => {
        count += 1;
        console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Stateless Example</p>
            <p> Count: {count}</p> {/*Not Updating*/}
            <button onClick={increment}>Click</button>
        </div>
    )
    }

    export default ComponentState;
    ```

## Q10. What are Props in JSX? `V. IMP.`

**props (properties)** are a way to `pass data` from a parent component to a child component.

```javascript
function App() {
    return (
        <ChildComponent name="Happy" purpose="Interview" />
    );
}
```

```javascript
function ChildComponent(props) {
    return <div>{props.name}, {props.purpose}!</div>;
}
```
