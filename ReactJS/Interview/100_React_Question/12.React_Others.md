# 100 React Questions (Others)

## Q1. What is a Higher-Order Component in React? `V. IMP.`

A Higher-Order component is a component which takes `another component as a arguement` and adds extra features to another component.

HOC can be used for providing `logging functionality` to all the components in a reusable way.

### HocLogger.js: 
```javascript
//High Order Component
const HocLogger = (HocUse) => {
  return function WithLogger(props) {
    console.log("I am from logger");
    return <HocUse />;
  };
};
export default HocLogger;

// HocUse.js: Normal Component will HOC
const HocUse = () => {
  return <div>My Component Content</div>;
};

export default Hoc(HocUse);
```

### index.js
```javascript
root.render(<HocUse></HocUse>);
```

## Q2. What are the 5 ways to Style React components? Explain Inline Styles?

5 ways to Style React components

* Inline Styles

* CSS Stylesheets

* CSS-Modules

* Global Stylesheets

* CSS Frameworks

### inline styles
```javascript
import React from "react";

const AppInlineStyle = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1 style={inlineStyles.title}>Inline</h1>
        </div>
    );
};

const inlineStyles = {
    title: {
        color: "blue",
        fontSize: "24px",
    },
};

export default AppInlineStyle;
```

## Q3. What are the differences between React & React Native?

| Feature | React | React Native |
|---|---|---|
| Type | Library | Framework |
| Purpose | Building web interfaces | Building mobile applications |
| Platform | Web browsers | iOS and Android |
| UI | HTML and CSS | Native UI components (e.g., View, Text) |
| Deployment | As web applications | Through app stores (e.g., App Store, Google Play) |

## Q4. What is GraphQL?

* GraphQL is a `query language for APIs` (Application Programming Interfaces) and a runtime for executing those queries with your existing data.

* GraphQL and React are often used together. React components can use GraphQL queries to fetch the data required for rendering.

```GraphQL
query {
  user(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}
```

## Q5. What are the Top 3 ways to achieve state management? When to use what in React?

| State Management Solution | When to Use | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| useState Hook | `Simple component-level state` | Ideal for applications having small components and isolated state because it is Lightweight and built into React only. |
| Context API | `Prop drilling` avoidance for sharing global data. | Simplifies data passing through the component tree, reducing the need for manual prop drilling. |
| Redux | Large-scale applications with `complex state`. | Centralized store and actions provide a predictable state management pattern, aiding in `debugging and scalability`. |

## Q6. How can you Implement Authentication in a React application? `V. IMP.`

1. Send `POST request` POST:{username, password}

2. Authenticate & create `JWT token`

3. Return Response {JWT token}

4. Store JWT token at `local storage`

5. Request Data {JWT token: `Header`}

6. Validate token signature on `server-side`

7. Send Data back to `client-side`

8. Display data on browser

## Q7. What is the use of React Profiler?

* React Profiler is a set of tools in React that allows developers to profile(analyze) the performance of a React application.

    ```javascript
    // Wrap the section of code you want to profile with the React Profiler component.
    <React.Profiler id="example" onRender={callback}>
        {/* Your code to profile */}
    </React.Profiler>

    // Define a callback function (onRender) that will be called whenever the component tree within the Profiler is committed.
    function callback(id, phase, actualDuration, baseDuration, startTime, commitTime) {
        // Process profiling data
        // Start time, End Time, Execution Time
    }
    ```

## Q8. What is the difference between fetch & axios for api calls in React?

| Feature | fetch | Axios |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency | Built-in JavaScript function | Third-party library |
| Promise Support | Returns Promises | Returns Promises |
| Interceptors | No support | Supports interceptors |
| Complexity | Simpler for basic HTTP requests | More features for advanced use cases |

### fetch
```javascript
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => console.log(data))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

### axios
```javascript
// Installation command: npm install axios
import axios from "axios";
axios
    .get("https://api.example.com/data")
    .then((response) => console.log(response.data))
    .catch((error) => console.error("Error:", error));
```

## Q9. What are the popular Testing Libraries for React?

* Jest

* React Testing Library

* Enzyme

* Cypress

## Q10. How can you Optimize Performance in a React application? `V. IMP.`

| Technique | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Memoization with useMemo and useCallback | Use this hooks to memoize values and, reducing unnecessary recalculations. |
| Optimizing Renders with React.Fragment | Use it to avoid unnecessary wrapper elements that could cause additional DOM nodes. |
| Lazy Loading with React.lazy | Use it to load components lazily, reducing the initial bundle size and improving initial loading performance. |
| Code Splitting | Employ code splitting to divide your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand, improving initial load times. |
| Optimizing Images and Assets | Compress and optimize images, use responsive images, and leverage lazy loading for images to reduce network and rendering overhead. |


## Q11. Explain Reactive Programming with example?

### Reactive Programming
* A programming paradigm that focuses on reacting to changes and events in a declarative and asynchronous manner.

### Declarative Programming
* A programming style where you write the code for what you want to achieve, rather than specifying step-by-step how to achieve it.
* Example: JSX in React has declarative syntax.

### Asynchronous
* An action that does not block other actions.

## Q12. In how many ways can we implement Reactive Programming in React?

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| State and Props | Reacting to changes in local component state and passing data reactively through props. |
| React Hooks | Leveraging useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components. |
| Event Handling | Reacting to user interactions through event handling and updating state accordingly. |
| Context API | Sharing and managing global state reactively across components using the Context API. |
| Redux | Using state management libraries like Redux for managing complex application state reactively. |
| Component Lifecycle Methods | Using class components and lifecycle methods for handling side effects and updates. |
| Async/Await | Utilizing async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations reactively. |
| RxJS and Observables | Leveraging RxJS for handling asynchronous operations and data streams in a reactive manner. |

## Q13. How to pass data from child component to parent Component in React?

Parent provides a `callback function` to child and then child component can then invoke this callback to pass data back to the parent.

```javascript
const ParentComponent = () => {
  // Callback to receive data from the child
  const callback = (data) => {
    console.log("Data from Child:", data);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Pass the callback to the child */}
      <ChildComponent fromChild={callback} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default ParentComponent
```

```javascript
const ChildComponent = ({ fromChild }) => {
  // No local state in the child component

  const dataToParent = () => {
    // Directly pass the input value to the parent
    fromChild(document.getElementById("inputField").value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" id="inputField" />
      <button onClick={dataToParent}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ChildComponent
```
