# 100 React Questions (Code Splitting)

## Q1. What is Code Splitting in React? `V. IMP.`

Code splitting is a technique to split the JavaScript bundle into `smaller chunks`, which are `loaded on-demand`.

## Q2. How to Implement Code Splitting in React? `V. IMP.`

* Use React.lazy() to lazily import components.

* Wrap components with Suspense to handle loading.

* Configure your build tool (e.g., Webpack) for dynamic imports.

    ```javascript
    const CodeSplit = () => {
    return <div>My component!</div>;
    };

    export default CodeSplit;
    ```

    ### App.js
    ```javascript
    import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

    const CodeSplit = lazy(() => import("./Others/CodeSplit"));

    function App() {
    return (
        <div>
        <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
            <CodeSplit />
        </Suspense>
        </div>
    );
    }
    ```

    ## webpack installation command
    ```javascript
    // npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
    // other webpack configuration...
    output: {
        filename: '[name].bundle.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    };
    ```

## Q3. What is the role of Lazy and Suspense methods in React? `V. IMP.`

* React.lazy is a function that allows you to `load a component lazily`.

* It enables code splitting by allowing you to import a component asynchronously/dynamically, meaning the component is loaded only when needed.

* The Suspense component is used to display a fallback UI while the lazily loaded component is being fetched.

### App.js
```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

const CodeSplit = lazy(() => import("./Others/CodeSplit"));

function App() {
return (
    <div>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <CodeSplit />
    </Suspense>
    </div>
);
}
```

## Q4. What are the Pros and Cons of Code Splitting?

### Pros:
| Pros of Code Splitting | Description |
|---|---|
| Faster Initial Load Time | Code splitting reduces the initial load time of your application by only loading the necessary code for the current view or feature. Good for performance. |
| Optimized Bandwidth Usage | By loading only the code needed for a specific page, it reduces the amount of data transferred over the network. Good for slow networks. |
| Improved Caching | Smaller, more focused code chunks are more likely to be cached by the browser. |
| Parallel Loading | Multiple smaller chunks can be loaded simultaneously, leading to faster overall loading times. |
| Easier Maintenance | Code splitting can make your codebase more modular, independent, and easier to maintain. |

### Cons:
| Cons of Code Splitting | Description |
|---|---|
| Complexity | Implementing code splitting introduces additional complexity to your application. This complexity can make the development process slow. |
| Tooling Dependencies | Proper code splitting often requires specific build tools and configurations, such as Webpack and Babel. Managing these tools is challenging. |
| Potential for Runtime Errors | Dynamically loading code at runtime can introduce the possibility of runtime errors. Careful testing is necessary to catch such issues. |
| Increased Number of Requests | Code splitting may increase the number of HTTP requests needed to fetch all the necessary chunks. This can impact performance. |
| Learning Curve | Developers who are new to code splitting may need time to understand the concepts and best practices. This can be a challenging. |

## Q5. What is the role of the import() function in code splitting?

The import() function returns a promise that allow `dyanmic loading of modules`.

### App.js
```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from "react";

const CodeSplit = lazy(() => import("./Others/CodeSplit"));

function App() {
return (
    <div>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <CodeSplit />
    </Suspense>
    </div>
);
}
```

## Q6. What is the purpose of the fallback prop in Suspense?

The fallback prop provides a `loading indicator` or UI while the dynamically imported component is being loaded.

## Q7. Can you dynamically load CSS files using code splitting in React?

`Yes`, using dynamic import() for CSS files allows you to load styles on-demand along with the corresponding components.

## Q8. How do you inspect and analyze the generated chunks in a React application?

Use tools like `Webpack Bundle Analyzer` to analyze the size and composition of chunks.
