# 100 React Questions (Components LifeCycle Methods - I)

## Q1. What are Component life cycle phases? `V. IMP.`

| Phase | Description |
|---|---|
| Mounting Phase | This phase occurs when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM. |
| Updating Phase | This phase occurs when a component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state. |
| Unmounting Phase | This phase occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM. |

## Q2. What are Component life cycle methods? `V. IMP.`

Component lifecycle methods are special methods that get called at various stages of a component's life.

| Mounting Phase  | Updating Phase | Unmounting Phase |
| -- | -- | -- |
| constructor() | getDerivedStateFromProps | componentWillUnmount |
| getDerivedStateFromProps | shouldComponentUpdate | |
| render | render() | |
| componentDidMount | getSnapshotBeforeUpdate | |
| | componentDidUpdate() | |

## Q3. What are Constructors in class components? When to use them?

* A constructor is a special method that is called when an instance of a class is created.

* Constructors are used for initializing the component's state or performing any setup needed before the component is rendered.

```javascript
class ConstructorExample extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    // Initialize the state
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  render() {
    return(
        <h2>Count: {this.state.count}</h2>
    );
  }
}

export default ConstructorExample
```

## Q4. What is the role of super keyword in constructor?

* The `super` keyword is used in the constructor of a class component to `call the constructor of the parent class`.
* This is necessary to ensure that the initialization logic of the parent class is executed.

## Q5. What is the role of render() method in component life cycle?

Render() method `returns the React elements` that will be rendered to the DOM.

## Q6. How the State can be maintained in a class component? `V.IMP.`

* Two step process to maintain state:

    * `this.setState()` method is used to update the state.

    * `this.state` property is used to render the update state in DOM.

## Q7. What is the role of componentDidMount() method in component life cycle?

componentDidMount() lifecycle method in React is the part of mounting phase and is `called after a component has been rendered` to the DOM.

* Mostly used for `side effects`. For example, external data fetching or setting up subscriptions.

```javascript
// Fetch data from API example using
// componentDidMount life cycle method

class CompDidMount extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        // 1. Component initialization
        this.state = {
            data: null
        };
    }

    // 2. componentDidMount is called after the component is added to the DOM 
    componentDidMount() {
        // 3. Fetch data from an API and update state with fetch data
    fetchData().then((data) => {
      this.setState({ data });
    });
  }

// 4. Render the component's UI using the fetched data.
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Data: {this.state.data}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default CompDidMount;
```
