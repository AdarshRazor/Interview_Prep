# 100 React Questions (Hooks - useState/useEffect)

## Q1. What are React Hooks? What are the Top React Hooks? `V. IMP.`

* React Hooks are inbuilt functions provided by React that allow functional components to use state and lifecycle features.

* Before Hooks, class components lifecycle methods were used to maintain state in React applications.

* To use React Hook first we first have to import it from React library:

```javascript
// Import Hook from the React library
import React, { useState } from "react";
```

* **useState**: State
* **useEffect**: Side effects
* **useContext**: Context
* **useReducer**: Complex state
* **useCallback**: Memoization
* **useMemo**: Performance
* **useRef**: Refs
* **useLayoutEffect**: Synchronous Side effects

## Q2. What are State, Stateless, Stateful, and State Management terms? `V. IMP.`

* "state" refers to the current data of the component.
* Stateful or state management means, when a user performs some actions on the UI, then the React application should be able to `update and re-render that data or state` on the UI.

```javascript
import React from "react";

// Stateless Example
function ComponentState() {
    let count = 0; // Initial state

    const increment = () => {
        count += 1; // State updated
        console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Stateless Example</p>
            <p>Count: {count}</p> {/* Not updating */}
            <button onClick={increment}>Click</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ComponentState;
```

## Q3. What is the role of useState() hook and how it works? `V. IMP.`

* The useState hook enables functional components to `manage state`.

* useState() working: useState() function accepts the initial state value as the parameter and returns an array with two elements:
    * The first element is the current state value (count in this code).
    * Second element is the function that is used to update the state (setCount in this code).

* The concept of assigning array elements to individual variables is called `array destructuring`.

```javascript
// state is the current state value.
// setState is a function that used to update the state.
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function UseState() {
    // array destructuring
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(count + 1);
        console.log(`Count: ${count + 1}`);
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Stateful Example</p>
            <p>Count: {count} {/* Updating */}</p>
            <button onClick={increment}>Click</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default UseState
```

## Q4. What is the role of useEffect()? How it works and what is its use? `V. IMP.`

* The useEffect Hook in React is used to perform side effects in functional components.
    * For example, data fetching from API, subscriptions, or any other operation that needs to be performed after the component has been rendered.

2 points to remember about useEffect():
* useEffect() is called after the component renders. Example, side effects.
* useEffect() function will accept two parameters: (Effect function, dependency array).

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function UseEffect() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
      const result = await response.json();
      console.log("Title:", result.title);
    };
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return(
    <div>
        <p>Data is being fetched ...</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default UseEffect;
```

## Q5. What is Dependency Array in useEffect() hook?

Dependencies arrays (optional) act as triggers for useEffect to rerun; meaning if any of dependencies values change, the code inside useEffect() will be executed again.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Side effect code here

  // Optional cleanup code

  return () => {
    // Cleanup code here
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

## Q6. What is the meaning of the empty array [] in the useEffect()?

An empty array[] indicates that the effect function should only `run once`

```javascript
function UseEffect() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({});

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1");
      const result = await response.json();
      setData(result);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Title: {data.title}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
