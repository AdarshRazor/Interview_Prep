# 100 React Questions (Hooks - useContext/useReducer)

## Q1. What is the role of useContext() hook? `V. IMP.`

useContext in React provides a way to pass data from parent to child component without using props.

### MyContext.js
```javascript
import { createContext } from "react";

const MyContext = createContext();
export default MyContext;
```

### Parent.js
```javascript
const Parent = () => {
    const contextValue = "Hello from Context!";
    
    return (
        <MyContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
            {/* Your component tree */}
            <Child />
        </MyContext.Provider>
    );
};
export default Parent;
```

### Child.js
```javascript
const Child = () => {
    const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);

    return <p>{contextValue}</p>;

    // return (
    // <MyContext.Consumer>
    //     {(contextValue) => <div>{contextValue}</div>}
    // </MyContext.Consumer>
    // );
};
export default Child;
```

## Q2. What is createContext() method? What are Provider & Consumer properties?

* The createContext() function returns an object with Provider and Consumer properties.

* The Provider property is responsible for providing the context value to all its child components.

* The useContext() method or Consumer property can be used to consume the context value in child components.

## Q3. When to use useContext() hook instead of props in real applications?

Use useContext instead of props when you want to `avoid prop drilling` and access context values directly within deeply nested components.
