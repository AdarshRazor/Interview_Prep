Components

building blocks, visible parts, button, inpouts, use as mnay times as u want. 
every component is a function which return markup. they return JSX 
unlike html (static content), React is Dynamic. 
display data using {...} 
JS Function return only one thing, that why we need to wrap up everything in one div or empty compoenent

Props

properties of an object.
Make prop, give it a value and use pro value.
can u pass anything as a prop ? YES
KEY PROP: react can tell one component apart from another. unique property to identify the component. so it can give error. Use index of map function instead.

rendering
take the code and display the result.
use something like Virtual DOM 'VDOM' to know how and when to render something. DOM (Document Object Model)
