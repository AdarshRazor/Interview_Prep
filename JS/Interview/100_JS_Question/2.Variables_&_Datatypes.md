# 100 JS Questions (Variables & Datatypes)

## Q1. What are variables? What is the difference between var, let, and const?

| Feature | `var` | `let` | `const` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scope | Function-scoped | Block-scoped | Block-scoped |
| Redeclaration | Allowed | Not allowed within the same scope | Not allowed |
| Reassignment | Allowed | Allowed | Not allowed |
| Hoisting | Hoisted to the top of the function scope | Hoisted to the top of the block scope, but not initialized | Hoisted to the top of the block scope, but not initialized |
| Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) | No | Exists before declaration | Exists before declaration |

## Q2. What are data types in JS?

A **data type** determines the type of variable.

| Primitive | Non-Primitive |
|---|---|
| Numbers | Object |
| Strings | Array |
| Booleans | Function |
| Undefined | Date |
| Null | RegExp |

## Q3. What is the difference between primitive and non-primitive data types?

| Feature | Primitive Data Types | Non-primitive Data Types |
|---|---|---|
| Types | Number, string, Boolean, undefined, null | Object, array, function, date, RegExp |
| Values | Can hold only a single value | Can hold multiple values and methods |
| Mutability | Immutable (cannot be changed) | Mutable (can be changed) |
| Complexity | Simple data types | Complex data types |

## Q4. What is the difference between null and undefined in JS?

### Undefined:
* When a variable is declared but has not been assigned a value, it is automatically initialized with undefined.
* Undefined can be used when you don't have the value right now, but you will get it after some logic or operation.

    ```javascript
    let undefinedVariable; // no value assigned
    console.log(undefinedVariable); // Output: undefined
    ```

### Null:
* null variables are intentionally assigned the null value.
* null can be used when you are sure you do not have any value for the particular variable.

    ```javascript    
    let nullVariable = null; // null assigned
    console.log(nullVariable); // Output: null
    ```

## Q5. What is the use of typeof operator?

The typeof operator is used to determine the data `type` of a variable.

Real application use -> typeOf operator can be used to `valiate the data` received from external sources(api).

```javascript
let num = 42;
let str = "Hello, world!";
let bool = true;
let obj = { key: "value" };
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let func = function() {};

// using typeof
console.log(typeof num); // Output: "number"
console.log(typeof str); // Output: "string"
console.log(typeof bool); // Output: "boolean"
console.log(typeof obj); // Output: "object"
console.log(typeof arr); // Output: "object"
console.log(typeof func); // Output: "function"
console.log(typeof undefinedVariable); // Output: "undefined"
```

## Q6. What is type coercion in JS? `V.IMP.`

Type coercion is the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another during certain operations or comparisons.

Uses of type coercion:
* Type coercion can be used during `String and Number concatenation`.
* Type coercion can be used while using `Comparison operators`.

```javascript
let string = "42";
let number = 42;
let boolean = true;
let nullValue = null;

// Type coercion (automatic conversion)
console.log(string + number); // Output: "4242"
console.log(number + boolean); // Output: 43
console.log(number == string); // Output: true
console.log(boolean == 1); // Output: true
console.log(boolean + nullValue); // Output: 1
```
