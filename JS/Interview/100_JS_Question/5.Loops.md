# 100 JS Questions (Loops)

## Q1. What is a loop? What are the types of loops in JS?

A loop is a programming way to run a piece of **code repeatedly** until a certain condition is met.

| Loop Type | Definition | Syntax | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `for` | Executes a block of code a specified number of times. | `for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) { // code to be executed }` | `for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { console.log(i); }` |
| `while` | Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. | `while (condition) { // code to be executed }` | `let x = 0; while (x < 5) { console.log(x); x++; }` |
| `do-while` | Executes a block of code at least once, then repeats as long as a specified condition is true. | `do { // code to be executed } while (condition);` | `let x = 0; do { console.log(x); x++; } while (x < 5);` |
| `for...of` | Iterates over the elements of an iterable object (e.g., arrays, strings). | `for (let element of iterable) { // code to be executed }` | `let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]; for (let fruit of fruits) { console.log(fruit); }` |
| `for...in` | Iterates over the properties of an object. | `for (let property in object) { // code to be executed }` | `let person = { name: "Alice", age: 30 }; for (let prop in person) { console.log(prop + ": " + person[prop]); }` |

## Q2. What is the difference between while and for loops?

### For loop:

* Iterates a block of code a specific number of times.
* Better for conditions with initialization and increment because all can be set in one line of code.

```javascript
//for loop
for (let i=0; i<5; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
//Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

### While loop:

* Executes a block of code while a certain condition is true.
* Better when there is only a condition, no initialization, and no increment.

```js
//while loop
let j = 0

while (j<5) {
    console.log(j);
    j++
}
//Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

### Extras:

```js
//condition only
while ("a"=="a"){
    console.log("Happy")
}
//Output: Happy (infinity)
```

## Q3. What is the difference between while and do-while loops? `V.IMP.`

### While loop:
* Executes a block of code while a certain condition is true.

```js
// while loop
let j = 0;

while (j < 5) {
  console.log(j);
  j++;
}

// Output: 0 1 2 3 4
```

### Do-while loop:
* Similar to the while loop, except that the block of code is `executed at least once`, even if the condition is false.

```js
// do-while loop
let k = 0;

do {
  console.log(k);
  k++;
} while (k > 1);

// Output: 0
```

## Q4. What is the difference between break and continue statements? `V.IMP.`

### break statement:
* Terminates the loop.

```javaScript
// break statement
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    break;
  }
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1 2
```

### continue statement:
* `Skips the current iteration` of the loop and moves on to the next iteration.

```JavaScript
// continue statement
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }
  console.log(i);
}

// Output: 1 2 4 5
```

## Q5. What is the difference between `for` and `for...of` loops in JS?

### for loop:
* Slightly more complex with more lines of code.

```JavaScript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

// Output: 1 2 3
```

### for...of loop:
* `Much simpler` and better for iterating arrays.

```JavaScript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

for (let val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}

// Output: 1 2 3
```

## Q6. What is the difference between for...of and for...in loops?

### for...of loop:
* Used to loop through the values of an object like arrays, strings.
* Allows you to access each value directly, without having to use an index.

```JavaScript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];

for (let val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}

// Output: 1 2 3
```

### for...in loop:
* Used to loop through the properties of an object.
* Allows you to iterate over the keys of an object and access the values associated by using keys as the index.

```JavaScript
const person = {
  name: 'Happy',
  role: 'Developer'
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(person[key]);
}

// Output: Happy Developer
```

## Q7. What is the `forEach` method? Compare it with `for...of` and `for...in` loops.

### forEach() method:
* Available on arrays or objects.
* Iterates over each element of the array or object and performs some action on each element.

```JavaScript
const array = [1, 2, 3];

//for...of loop
for (let item of array) {
  console.log(item);
}
// Output: 1 2 3

//forEach method
array.forEach(function(item) {
  console.log(item);
});

// Output: 1 2 3
```

```js
const person = {
  name: 'Happy',
  role: 'Developer'
};

//for-in loop
for (let key in person) {
  console.log(person[key]);
}
// Output: Happy Developer

//forEach method
Object.values(person).forEach(value =>{
    console.log(value);
})
//Output: Happy Developer
```

### Key differences:
* `forEach` is a method specific to arrays and objects, while `for...of` and `for...in` are more general loop constructs.
* `for...of` iterates over values, while `for...in` iterates over keys.
* `forEach` doesn't provide a way to break out of the loop early, while `for...of` and `for...in` do.

## Q8. When to use for...of loops and when to use the forEach method in applications?

* The for...of loop is suitable when you need `more control over the loop`, such as using the break or continue statement inside.

* The forEach method `iterates over each element` of the array and performs some action on each element.

```JavaScript
const array = [1, 2, 3];

// for-of loop
for (let item of array) {
  console.log(item);
  if (item === 2) {
    break; // Exit the loop when item is 2
  }
}
// Output: 1 2

// forEach method
array.forEach(function(item) {
  console.log(item);
  if (item === 2) {
    break; // Error: Illegal break statement
  }
});
```
